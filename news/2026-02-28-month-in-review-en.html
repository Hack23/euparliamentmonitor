    <div class="article-content">
      <section class="lede">
        <p>February 2026 saw the European Parliament maintain a robust legislative tempo as the tenth parliamentary term entered its second year. With the legislative pipeline showing strong momentum — a pipeline health score of 100 and zero stalled procedures — the institution demonstrated efficient inter-institutional coordination across all major procedure types. From ordinary legislative procedures to consultation and non-legislative files, the Parliament processed a heavy workload against the backdrop of evolving geopolitical pressures and an intensifying policy agenda on climate, digital governance, and defence.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="month-in-numbers">
        <h2>The Month in Numbers</h2>
        <p>The Parliament's February activity reflected an institution operating at high throughput:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Legislative pipeline health:</strong> 100/100 — no stalled procedures and strong legislative momentum across all active files</li>
          <li><strong>Active procedures:</strong> 20 legislative files in active processing, spanning ordinary legislative (COD), consultation (CNS), and non-legislative (NLE) procedure types</li>
          <li><strong>Bottleneck index:</strong> 0 — no identified procedural blockages in the inter-institutional pipeline</li>
          <li><strong>Estimated clearance time:</strong> Approximately 30 days per active file, indicating efficient committee-stage processing</li>
          <li><strong>Plenary sessions:</strong> Multiple sessions held in both Strasbourg and Brussels, maintaining the Parliament's regular sitting rhythm</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="legislative-output">
        <h2>Legislative Output</h2>
        <p>February's legislative activity was dominated by the steady progression of ordinary legislative procedures (COD), which constitute the majority of the Parliament's co-decision workload. Several files advanced from committee deliberation toward plenary reading, while consultation procedures (CNS) moved through the pipeline with comparable efficiency.</p>
        <p>The absence of bottlenecks suggests that rapporteurs, shadow rapporteurs, and committee coordinators maintained effective negotiating rhythms — a notable achievement given the complexity of files spanning environmental regulation, digital transition, and industrial policy. Non-legislative procedures (NLE), including international agreement approvals, continued to clear the pipeline without material delays.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="coalition-dynamics">
        <h2>Coalition Dynamics</h2>
        <p>The political landscape in February 2026 remained characterised by the dominant centrist coalition anchored by the European People's Party (EPP), the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&amp;D), and Renew Europe. This grand coalition configuration, which commands a comfortable majority in the hemicycle, proved stable through the month's plenary votes.</p>
        <p>However, the early warning system flagged structural concentration as a risk factor. With the largest political formation holding substantial seat share, monitoring for procedural overreach and ensuring robust inter-group checks and balances remain essential. The effective number of parties indicator — reflecting low parliamentary fragmentation — suggests a consolidated political structure that facilitates legislative efficiency but may constrain minority perspectives.</p>
        <p>Cross-party alliances continued to emerge on specific policy files, particularly where environmental and industrial interests intersect. The Greens/EFA and ECR groups each found issue-specific alignment opportunities with the centrist bloc, signalling fluid coalition dynamics beneath the surface of structural stability.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="committee-highlights">
        <h2>Committee Highlights</h2>
        <p>February's committee work was marked by intensive deliberation across several key standing committees:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>ENVI</strong> (Environment, Public Health and Food Safety) — Advanced environmental regulation files with a contested amendment landscape, reflecting ongoing tensions between ambition and pragmatism in EU climate policy. The committee's workload remained among the heaviest in the Parliament.</li>
          <li><strong>ITRE</strong> (Industry, Research and Energy) — Continued work on digital transition dossiers and energy security files, with progress on AI governance and industrial competitiveness frameworks.</li>
          <li><strong>LIBE</strong> (Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs) — Addressed migration governance and fundamental rights files, maintaining steady progress on politically sensitive dossiers.</li>
          <li><strong>AFET</strong> (Foreign Affairs) — Engaged with external relations priorities in the context of an evolving geopolitical environment, preparing reports for spring plenary consideration.</li>
          <li><strong>ECON</strong> (Economic and Monetary Affairs) — Progressed economic governance files and continued scrutiny of banking union and capital markets union proposals.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="opposition-activity">
        <h2>Opposition Activity</h2>
        <p>Opposition groups — including The Left (GUE/NGL), Identity and Democracy (ID), and elements of the ECR — maintained scrutiny pressure through parliamentary questions and amendment proposals. Key areas of opposition activity included fiscal policy direction, migration management approaches, and the pace of green transition measures.</p>
        <p>Parliamentary questions filed during February reflected opposition priorities around social policy impacts, democratic accountability of EU institutions, and the distributional effects of climate legislation on member state economies. The questioning pattern suggests a strategic focus on government accountability themes ahead of the mid-term period.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="policy-trends">
        <h2>Policy Trends</h2>
        <p>Three overarching policy trends defined the February landscape:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Digital governance acceleration:</strong> AI regulation, data governance, and digital market oversight continued to absorb significant legislative attention, with cross-committee coordination between ITRE, LIBE, and IMCO on interconnected digital files.</li>
          <li><strong>Defence and security mainstreaming:</strong> Growing cross-party convergence on EU defence procurement and capability development reflected intensifying geopolitical pressures, with defence-related budget lines receiving broader political support than in previous terms.</li>
          <li><strong>Climate policy recalibration:</strong> ENVI's contested amendment landscape suggested an ongoing recalibration of the EU's climate ambition — balancing the European Green Deal's targets with industrial competitiveness concerns and energy security imperatives.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="most-consequential">
        <h2>The Month's Most Consequential Development</h2>
        <p>February 2026's defining development was the sustained legislative momentum demonstrated by the Parliament in a period of considerable policy complexity. The achievement of a perfect pipeline health score — with zero stalled procedures and strong throughput across all procedure types — underscored the institution's capacity to process a demanding workload efficiently. This matters because legislative velocity directly affects the EU's ability to respond to fast-moving policy challenges, from technology regulation to geopolitical crisis management.</p>
        <p>The structural stability of the centrist coalition, combined with the emergence of issue-specific cross-party alliances, suggests a Parliament that has found its operational rhythm in the current term. Yet the early warning system's flag on political concentration serves as a reminder that efficiency must be balanced with pluralism and robust democratic deliberation.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="looking-ahead">
        <h2>Looking Ahead: March 2026</h2>
        <p>March promises an intensive legislative calendar with spring plenary sessions in Strasbourg, trilogue negotiations on advanced files, and committee deadlines for key amendment rounds. Watch for coalition stress tests on contested environmental and digital files, defence spending consensus building, and the Parliament's positioning ahead of the spring European Council summit. The institution's ability to maintain February's strong legislative momentum through the busier spring session will be a critical test of inter-institutional coordination and political cohesion.</p>
