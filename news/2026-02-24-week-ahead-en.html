            <p>The European Parliament enters a consequential week as MEPs return to committee work and plenary preparations across Brussels. With multiple committees — including ENVI, ITRE, and LIBE — convening to advance key legislative files, the week of 2026-02-25 to 2026-03-04 will shape several critical policy trajectories. Environment and digital policy remain at the forefront, while the legislative pipeline shows 5 active files progressing through committee stage with 40 amendments under consideration.</p>

            <h2>Committee Activity</h2>
            <p>Three major committees are scheduled for intensive work sessions this week:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>ENVI</strong> (Environment, Public Health and Food Safety) — With 5 active legislative files and 15 documents in production, the committee will process approximately 40 amendments. The committee's adoption rate stands at 51%, indicating contested policy areas.</li>
                <li><strong>ITRE</strong> (Industry, Research and Energy) — Running parallel sessions focused on digital transition and energy security dossiers, with comparable workload intensity.</li>
                <li><strong>LIBE</strong> (Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs) — Advancing migration and fundamental rights files, with moderate engagement levels expected from its membership.</li>
              </ul>
          </section>
          <section class="legislative-pipeline">
            <h2>Legislative Pipeline</h2>
            <p>The active legislative pipeline shows healthy throughput with a pipeline health score of 100 and zero stalled procedures. Legislative momentum is assessed as <strong>STRONG</strong>, with no identified bottlenecks. This suggests efficient inter-institutional coordination at the current stage of the parliamentary term.</p>

            <h2>What to Watch</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Amendment battles in ENVI:</strong> With a 51% success rate on amendments, expect contested votes on environmental regulation details — outcomes will signal the Parliament's appetite for ambitious climate policy.</li>
                <li><strong>Cross-party dynamics:</strong> Coalition patterns between EPP, S&amp;D, and Renew will be closely watched, particularly on industrial policy files where traditional left-right divisions are blurring.</li>
                <li><strong>Digital transition agenda:</strong> ITRE's work on technology regulation may produce early signals on Parliament's approach to AI governance and digital sovereignty.</li>
                <li><strong>Rule of law monitoring:</strong> LIBE proceedings may touch on enlargement-related governance conditionality — a politically sensitive area as the EU weighs strategic expansion.</li>
              </ul>
