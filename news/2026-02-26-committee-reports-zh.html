    <div class="article-content">
      <section class="committee-overview">
        <p class="lede">The European Parliament's standing committees have advanced a broad legislative programme in the current term, spanning chemicals regulation, digital taxation reform, foreign policy resolutions on Iran, Azerbaijan and the Western Balkans, judicial cooperation agreements, and agricultural trade adjustments. This report analyses the output and strategic direction of five of the most active committees—ENVI, ECON, AFET, LIBE and AGRI—drawing on adopted texts, effectiveness metrics and pipeline data from the EP Open Data Portal.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="analysis-section">
        <h2>Committee Activity Overview</h2>
        <p>The 10th parliamentary term has seen sustained high workloads across all five featured committees, each managing over 100 active legislative files. While meeting data from the EP API remains limited, the volume of adopted texts and opinions delivered provides a clear signal of legislative momentum. All five committees registered a workload intensity rating of HIGH, with committee coverage rates at 20% of the parliamentary portfolio—reflecting the breadth of cross-cutting policy issues each body must address.</p>

        <h2>Thematic Analysis by Committee</h2>
        <div class="committee-reports">
      <section class="committee-card">
        <h3 class="committee-name">ENVI: Environment, Public Health and Food Safety</h3>
        <p>ENVI has focused its 10th-term agenda on building the regulatory architecture for Europe's chemicals strategy and corporate sustainability framework. The adoption of the common data platform on chemicals (TA-10-2025-0045) represents a foundational step toward centralised monitoring of chemical substances across the single market, responding to years of industry and civil society pressure for greater transparency. The committee also contributed to amendments postponing certain corporate sustainability reporting deadlines (TA-10-2025-0064), reflecting political compromise between environmental ambition and business readiness concerns. With 100 active legislative files and a HIGH workload intensity, ENVI continues to be one of the Parliament's most legislatively demanding committees.</p>

      </section>
      <section class="committee-card">
        <h3 class="committee-name">ECON: Economic and Monetary Affairs</h3>
        <p>ECON's legislative output this term is anchored by the landmark VAT digital age package (TA-10-2025-0012, TA-10-2025-0013), which overhauls cross-border VAT reporting and strengthens administrative cooperation between member state tax authorities. The reforms aim to close an estimated €60 billion annual VAT gap through mandatory digital reporting and enhanced data sharing. The committee also handled the appointment of a new Single Resolution Board member (TA-10-2025-0024) and the annual discharge procedures for EU agencies and joint undertakings (TA-10-2025-0088, TA-10-2025-0089), ensuring financial accountability across the institutional landscape.</p>

      </section>
      <section class="committee-card">
        <h3 class="committee-name">AFET: Foreign Affairs</h3>
        <p>AFET has produced the largest volume of adopted texts among the five committees examined, reflecting the intense geopolitical pressures on the European Parliament's external relations agenda. The committee addressed human rights crises in Iran (TA-10-2025-0004), Azerbaijan (TA-10-2025-0038) and Cameroon, while advancing the EU's enlargement process through detailed country reports on Türkiye (TA-10-2025-0092) and Serbia (TA-10-2025-0093). The establishment of a Reform and Growth Facility for Moldova (TA-10-2025-0022) and macro-financial assistance for Jordan (TA-10-2025-0048) demonstrate the Parliament's use of financial instruments as foreign policy tools. The annual CSDP implementation report (TA-10-2025-0058) provides the most comprehensive parliamentary assessment of EU defence capabilities amid rising security concerns.</p>

      <section class="committee-card">
        <h3 class="committee-name">LIBE: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs</h3>
        <p>LIBE's work this term intersects significantly with AFET on human rights resolutions, particularly regarding Iran and press freedom. The committee's contribution to the Eurojust cooperation agreement with Bosnia and Herzegovina (TA-10-2025-0055) strengthens the EU's judicial cooperation architecture in the Western Balkans, a priority as the region advances its accession prospects. Resolutions on the execution of activists in Iran (TA-10-2025-0062) and prosecution of journalists in Cameroon (TA-10-2025-0061) underscore LIBE's role as the Parliament's primary voice on individual rights and freedoms beyond EU borders. The committee delivered 2 formal opinions during the review period, contributing to cross-committee legislative coordination.</p>

      <section class="committee-card">
        <h3 class="committee-name">AGRI: Agriculture and Rural Development</h3>
        <p>AGRI's legislative focus includes the technical but commercially significant renegotiation of tariff-rate quotas with Norway following Brexit (TA-10-2025-0029). This agreement recalibrates agricultural market access arrangements disrupted by the UK's departure from the EU customs union, affecting dairy, seafood and processed food exporters across both the EU-27 and the EEA. The committee has also engaged with the broader internal market review (TA-10-2025-0107), examining how new commercial practices—including digital platforms and direct-to-consumer agricultural sales—challenge existing regulatory frameworks. With 100 active legislative files, AGRI maintains a high workload intensity even as its public profile remains lower than committees handling more politically visible dossiers.</p>
        <details>
          <summary>Key Adopted Texts</summary>
          <ul class="document-list">
            <li><strong>TA-10-2025-0029</strong>: EU-Norway Agreement: modification of concessions on all the tariff-rate quotas included in the EU Schedule CLXXV as a consequence of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union</li>

      <section class="strategic-context">
        <h2>Strategic Context</h2>
        <p>The current committee output reveals three dominant policy threads that will shape European governance in the coming months. First, the push for regulatory modernisation—visible in ECON's digital VAT package and ENVI's chemicals data platform—reflects Brussels' determination to maintain a competitive single market while tightening oversight. Second, AFET's extraordinary volume of human rights resolutions and enlargement reports signals that geopolitical volatility, from the South Caucasus to the Western Balkans, is consuming an increasing share of parliamentary bandwidth. Third, the convergence of LIBE and AFET work on Iran and judicial cooperation suggests growing demand for cross-committee coordination, a structural challenge the Parliament has historically handled unevenly.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="stakeholder-impact">
        <h2>Stakeholder Impact</h2>
        <p>For industry, ECON's VAT digitalisation rules and the corporate sustainability reporting amendments (TA-10-2025-0064) will require significant compliance investment from financial services firms and multinationals. Chemical manufacturers face new transparency obligations under ENVI's data platform regulation (TA-10-2025-0045). Agricultural exporters must adjust to revised tariff-rate quotas following the EU-Norway agreement (TA-10-2025-0029), while civil society organisations tracking human rights will find AFET and LIBE's resolutions on Iran, Azerbaijan and press freedom in Cameroon provide new leverage points for advocacy. Member states preparing EU accession dossiers—particularly Türkiye, Serbia and Moldova—should note the detailed benchmarking in the latest country reports.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="what-next">
        <h2>What Happens Next</h2>
        <p>Several key files are expected to advance through trilogue negotiations in the coming weeks. The VAT digital age package (TA-10-2025-0012) awaits Council common position, with a provisional agreement targeted before the summer recess. The chemicals monitoring framework (TA-10-2025-0045) will move to implementation planning once published in the Official Journal. AFET's annual CSDP implementation report (TA-10-2025-0058) will feed into the March European Council discussion on defence spending. Meanwhile, the Moldova Reform and Growth Facility (TA-10-2025-0022) is expected to enter into force by Q3 2026, unlocking conditional funding for Chisinau's EU accession reforms.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="methodology">
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>This report is generated from live data retrieved via the European Parliament MCP Server, covering adopted texts, committee documents, legislative pipeline status, and committee effectiveness scores. Committee activity analysis uses the EP Open Data Portal's corporate-bodies, committee-documents, procedures, and adopted-texts endpoints. Effectiveness scoring employs a multi-factor model benchmarking productivity, quality, and impact against peer committees.</p>
