      <h1>Week in Review: February 21–28, 2026</h1>
      <p class="article-subtitle">Committee preparatory work and written scrutiny defined a non-plenary week in Strasbourg and Brussels</p>
    </header>
    <div class="article-content">
      <section class="lede">
        <p>The European Parliament's week of February 21–28 was a constituency and committee work period, with no plenary votes scheduled. Nevertheless, MEPs remained active behind the scenes: more than twenty written parliamentary questions were formally tabled, signalling sustained legislative scrutiny across multiple policy domains. Political group stability remained high, with no voting anomalies or defection signals detected — a reflection of the consolidation phase within the 10th parliamentary term.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="week-summary">
        <h2>Week Summary: Top Developments</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>No plenary votes</strong> — This was a designated non-sitting week, with Parliament focused on committee-level preparatory work and constituency engagement.</li>
          <li><strong>20+ written questions tabled</strong> — MEPs submitted a wave of written questions (E-10-2026 series) to the European Commission, covering pending policy inquiries across environment, digital, and internal market portfolios.</li>
          <li><strong>Group stability at maximum</strong> — Voting anomaly detection recorded a group stability score of 100 with a LOW risk level, indicating no factional tensions or party-line defections.</li>
          <li><strong>Legislative pipeline healthy</strong> — Active legislative files continue to progress through committee stages with no identified bottlenecks in the inter-institutional process.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="parliamentary-questions">
        <h2>Parliamentary Questions &amp; Scrutiny</h2>
        <p>A batch of at least 20 written questions in the E-10-2026 series was formally registered during the review period. All questions carry PENDING status, awaiting Commission responses within the standard six-week deadline. The volume of questions — filed continuously through the week — underscores Parliament's persistent oversight role even outside plenary sessions.</p>
        <p>Written questions serve as a key accountability mechanism, requiring the Commission to respond publicly and on the record. The steady flow during a non-sitting week suggests MEPs are using the recess period to sharpen their scrutiny agendas ahead of upcoming plenary debates.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="political-dynamics">
        <h2>Political Dynamics</h2>
        <p>The week's political dynamics were characterised by calm. The anomaly detection system — which monitors party defections, abstention spikes, and attendance irregularities — reported zero anomalies across all political groups. The defection trend is classified as DECREASING, pointing to an extended period of internal group cohesion.</p>
        <p>This stability is consistent with the post-election consolidation pattern of the 10th parliamentary term, where political groups are still solidifying their positions and building cross-party alliances for the major legislative files ahead — particularly on green transition, digital sovereignty, and defence spending.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="what-mattered-most">
        <h2>What Mattered Most</h2>
        <p>The most consequential development this week was not a single vote or debate but the cumulative weight of parliamentary written scrutiny. With over 20 questions tabled to the Commission in a single week, MEPs are laying the groundwork for upcoming legislative confrontations. The questions serve as early signals of where political groups intend to press the Commission — and where potential fault lines may emerge when these dossiers reach plenary stage.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="looking-ahead">
        <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
        <p>As the Parliament returns to regular session rhythm in early March, attention will shift to committee votes on pending dossiers and preparation for the next Strasbourg plenary. The written questions tabled this week may trigger Commission responses that reshape upcoming debates. Key committees — including ENVI, ITRE, and LIBE — are expected to advance reports on environmental regulation, digital policy, and migration governance.</p>
