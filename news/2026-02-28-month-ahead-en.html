            <h2>Monthly Overview</h2>
            <p>March 2026 marks a pivotal month in the European Parliament's legislative calendar as the institution enters the second quarter of the tenth parliamentary term. With the spring session period in full swing, MEPs face an intensive schedule of plenary sessions in Strasbourg and committee work in Brussels. The legislative pipeline remains robust, with strong momentum and no identified bottlenecks — signalling efficient inter-institutional coordination. Key policy areas including digital transition, environmental regulation, and defence cooperation will dominate the agenda as the Parliament positions itself ahead of mid-term strategic reviews.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="week-by-week">
            <h2>Week-by-Week Preview</h2>
            <h3>Week 1: 2–6 March</h3>
            <p>Committee work sessions resume in Brussels following the February recess. ENVI, ITRE, and LIBE committees are expected to advance key legislative files, with environment and digital policy at the forefront. Amendment deadlines for several ongoing ordinary legislative procedures (COD) will shape the policy direction for the coming months.</p>
            <h3>Week 2: 9–13 March</h3>
            <p>The Strasbourg plenary session is anticipated to address critical files including reports from AFET on external relations priorities and INTA on international trade agreements. Voting sessions will test coalition dynamics between EPP, S&amp;D, and Renew Europe, particularly on industrial policy dossiers where traditional political boundaries are increasingly fluid.</p>
            <h3>Week 3: 16–20 March</h3>
            <p>A Brussels mini-plenary may be scheduled to handle overflow business. Committee rapporteurs will present draft reports on active legislative procedures, with DEVE and ECON preparing opinions on development cooperation and economic governance respectively. Interparliamentary delegation meetings may run in parallel.</p>
            <h3>Week 4: 23–27 March</h3>
            <p>Committee coordinators meet to set priorities for the April session. Trilogue negotiations on advanced legislative files are expected to intensify, with Council presidency teams seeking provisional agreements. The STOA panel may present technology assessment findings relevant to pending digital regulation proposals.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="policy-agenda">
            <h2>Policy Agenda</h2>
            <p>The March policy landscape is shaped by three overarching priorities:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Green Deal Implementation:</strong> ENVI continues work on environmental regulation details, with amendment battles expected on climate targets and biodiversity frameworks. The committee's track record suggests contested votes in this space.</li>
              <li><strong>Digital Sovereignty:</strong> ITRE advances technology regulation files, with AI governance and cybersecurity frameworks commanding significant attention. Implementation of the EU Cyber Resilience Act and NIS2 Directive remains a cross-cutting theme.</li>
              <li><strong>Security and Defence:</strong> AFET and the Subcommittee on Security and Defence (SEDE) are expected to discuss the evolving European defence posture, including procurement coordination and strategic autonomy considerations.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section class="committee-calendar">
            <h2>Committee Calendar</h2>
            <p>Key committees with significant work planned in March:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>ENVI</strong> (Environment, Public Health and Food Safety) — Multiple active legislative files on environmental regulation with ongoing amendment processing. Expect contested votes on green transition measures.</li>
              <li><strong>ITRE</strong> (Industry, Research and Energy) — Digital transition and energy security dossiers. Parallel sessions on technology regulation including AI and cybersecurity frameworks.</li>
              <li><strong>LIBE</strong> (Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs) — Migration and fundamental rights files advance through committee stage. Rule of law monitoring remains politically sensitive.</li>
              <li><strong>AFET</strong> (Foreign Affairs) — External relations priorities including enlargement policy and neighbourhood strategy. Geopolitical positioning papers expected.</li>
              <li><strong>INTA</strong> (International Trade) — Trade agreement negotiations and WTO reform discussions. Supply chain due diligence legislation in advanced stages.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section class="legislative-pipeline">
            <h2>Legislative Pipeline</h2>
            <p>The active legislative pipeline demonstrates a strong legislative momentum with a pipeline health score of 100 and a stalled procedure rate of zero. Multiple ordinary legislative procedures (COD), consultation procedures (CNS), and non-legislative procedures (NLE) are progressing through various stages. Key procedure types under active consideration include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Ordinary Legislative Procedures (COD):</strong> The backbone of EU lawmaking, several COD files are advancing through committee and approaching plenary vote stages. Low bottleneck risk suggests smooth institutional coordination.</li>
              <li><strong>Consultation Procedures (CNS):</strong> Council consultation files are progressing with estimated completion windows of approximately 30 days for several dossiers.</li>
              <li><strong>Non-Legislative Procedures (NLE):</strong> International agreement approvals and other non-legislative actions continue through the pipeline with minimal delays.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section class="what-to-watch">
            <h2>Watch Points</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Coalition stress tests:</strong> March plenary votes will reveal whether the centrist EPP–S&amp;D–Renew coalition holds on contested environmental and digital files, or whether issue-specific alliances with Greens/EFA or ECR emerge as alternative majorities.</li>
              <li><strong>Defence spending consensus:</strong> With geopolitical pressures mounting, watch for cross-party convergence on EU defence procurement and capability development — a traditionally divisive policy area showing signs of new consensus.</li>
              <li><strong>Enlargement conditionality:</strong> AFET deliberations on Western Balkans and Eastern Partnership progress reports may signal Parliament's stance on the pace and conditions of EU enlargement.</li>
              <li><strong>AI governance positioning:</strong> ITRE and LIBE joint work on artificial intelligence regulation could produce early signals on the Parliament's approach to balancing innovation promotion with fundamental rights protection.</li>
              <li><strong>Budget implementation oversight:</strong> BUDG and CONT committees will scrutinise NextGenerationEU disbursements and Recovery and Resilience Facility milestones — politically charged in the context of fiscal consolidation debates.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section class="international-context">
            <h2>International Context</h2>
            <p>The external environment in March 2026 is characterised by evolving transatlantic dynamics, ongoing geopolitical tensions in the EU's neighbourhood, and an intensifying global competition for technological and industrial leadership. The Parliament's external-facing work — through AFET, INTA, and interparliamentary delegations — will address EU strategic positioning on trade diversification, energy security partnerships, and multilateral governance reform. The spring European Council summit preparations will also begin to shape the Parliament's bargaining position on institutional priorities for the remainder of the legislative term.</p>
