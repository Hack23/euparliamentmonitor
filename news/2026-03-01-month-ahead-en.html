      <h1>Month Ahead: March 2026 — EP10 Spring Legislative Push</h1>
      <p class="article-subtitle">Strategic outlook for the European Parliament in March 2026: intensifying plenary sessions, advancing committee work, and critical legislative pipeline milestones in the second year of EP10</p>
    </header>
        <div class="article-content">

          <section class="monthly-overview">
            <h2>Monthly Overview</h2>
            <p>March 2026 opens a demanding legislative chapter for the European Parliament as the institution enters the second spring of its tenth parliamentary term. With 720 MEPs now fully settled into committee assignments and cross-party working relationships, the pace of legislative production is set to accelerate sharply. Precomputed parliamentary statistics project 53 plenary sessions and 114 legislative acts for the full year — both significant increases on the EP9/EP10 transition period of 2024, when election disruptions compressed output to 38 sessions and 72 acts. March typically ranks among the most productive months, with historical patterns indicating approximately four plenary sessions, eight legislative acts adopted, and over 190 committee meetings.</p>
            <p>The political landscape of EP10 is defined by its rightward shift: the European People's Party (EPP) leads with 188 seats (26.1%), followed by the Socialists &amp; Democrats (S&D) at 136 seats (18.9%). The new Patriots for Europe (PfE) group holds 84 seats (11.7%), the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) 78 seats (10.8%), and Renew Europe (RE) 77 seats (10.7%). The Greens/EFA (53), GUE/NGL (46), and the new Europe of Sovereign Nations (ESN, 25) complete the chamber. With a parliamentary fragmentation index of 6.14 — the highest in EP history — no two-party grand coalition is viable, requiring broader multi-group negotiations on every significant file.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="week-by-week">
            <h2>Week-by-Week Preview</h2>
            <h3>Week 1: 2–6 March</h3>
            <p>Committee coordinators resume following the late-February break, with ENVI (Environment) and ITRE (Industry, Research and Energy) advancing high-priority digital transition and environmental regulation dossiers. LIBE (Civil Liberties) is expected to hold hearings on migration policy implementation, a politically sensitive file given the rightward shift in chamber composition. Amendment deadlines for several ordinary legislative procedures (COD) will set the direction for spring plenary votes.</p>
            <h3>Week 2: 9–13 March</h3>
            <p>The principal Strasbourg plenary session of the month is scheduled for this week. Voting sessions will test coalition geometry across multiple policy areas. AFET (Foreign Affairs) reports on EU neighbourhood strategy and enlargement conditionality are expected to reach the floor. Trade policy files from INTA (International Trade) may also feature, with supply chain due diligence and WTO reform on the agenda. The effective number of parties (6.14) means floor managers must build issue-by-issue coalitions — watch for EPP–RE–ECR alignments on economic files and EPP–S&D–Greens/EFA configurations on social policy.</p>
            <h3>Week 3: 16–20 March</h3>
            <p>A potential Brussels mini-plenary addresses overflow legislative business. Committee rapporteurs present draft reports on active files: DEVE (Development) on cooperation frameworks, ECON (Economic and Monetary Affairs) on fiscal governance reform, and BUDG (Budgets) on NextGenerationEU disbursement oversight. The STOA (Science and Technology Options Assessment) panel may present technology assessment findings relevant to pending AI governance proposals.</p>
            <h3>Week 4: 23–27 March</h3>
            <p>Trilogue negotiations on advanced legislative files intensify as the Council presidency pushes for provisional agreements before the Easter recess. Committee chairs meet to finalise April session priorities. Interparliamentary delegations may convene bilateral meetings with candidate country parliaments, advancing the enlargement dialogue. The legislative pipeline health score remains at 100 with zero stalled procedures, suggesting strong inter-institutional momentum heading into the spring session peak.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="policy-agenda">
            <h2>Policy Agenda</h2>
            <p>Three overarching policy priorities define the March agenda:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Green Deal Implementation:</strong> ENVI continues detailed work on climate targets, biodiversity frameworks, and circular economy legislation. With the Greens/EFA reduced to 53 seats but still pivotal for progressive coalitions, amendment battles on environmental ambition will reveal the true centre of gravity in EP10.</li>
              <li><strong>Digital Sovereignty &amp; AI Governance:</strong> ITRE leads on technology regulation, with the EU Cyber Resilience Act implementation and AI governance frameworks commanding cross-committee attention. LIBE's parallel work on fundamental rights implications creates a dual-track legislative dynamic requiring careful coordination.</li>
              <li><strong>Defence &amp; Security Architecture:</strong> Defence policy gained prominence in EP10, with AFET and the Subcommittee on Security and Defence (SEDE) advancing proposals on EU defence procurement, capability development, and strategic autonomy. Cross-party convergence on defence spending — traditionally a divisive area — signals a significant political realignment driven by geopolitical pressures.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section class="committee-calendar">
            <h2>Committee Calendar</h2>
            <p>March 2026 is expected to see approximately 193 committee meetings across all standing committees. Key highlights:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>ENVI</strong> (Environment, Public Health and Food Safety) — Climate package amendments, biodiversity strategy implementation, pharmaceutical legislation review.</li>
              <li><strong>ITRE</strong> (Industry, Research and Energy) — AI Act implementation monitoring, Cyber Resilience Act delegated acts, energy market reform.</li>
              <li><strong>LIBE</strong> (Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs) — Migration pact implementation, rule of law monitoring, digital identity regulation.</li>
              <li><strong>AFET</strong> (Foreign Affairs) — Enlargement progress reports, neighbourhood policy review, EU–NATO cooperation framework.</li>
              <li><strong>INTA</strong> (International Trade) — Trade defence instruments, supply chain due diligence, WTO reform positioning.</li>
              <li><strong>ECON</strong> (Economic and Monetary Affairs) — Banking union completion, economic governance review, digital euro legislative framework.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section class="legislative-pipeline">
            <h2>Legislative Pipeline</h2>
            <p>The active legislative pipeline demonstrates strong momentum heading into March. With a health score of 100 and zero stalled procedures, inter-institutional coordination is operating efficiently. Projections for 2026 anticipate 114 legislative acts adopted — a 58% increase over the 2024 transition year. Multiple procedure types are progressing concurrently:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Ordinary Legislative Procedure (COD):</strong> The majority of active files follow the codecision track. Several COD procedures are approaching committee vote or plenary reading stages, with low bottleneck risk across the board.</li>
              <li><strong>Consultation Procedures (CNS):</strong> Council consultation files on taxation and judicial cooperation continue through committee examination with estimated 30-day completion windows.</li>
              <li><strong>Non-Legislative Procedures (NLE):</strong> International agreement approvals — including trade partnerships and security cooperation frameworks — proceed with minimal delays.</li>
              <li><strong>Consent Procedures:</strong> Parliament's consent on international agreements and institutional appointments moves through AFET and LIBE.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section class="what-to-watch">
            <h2>Watch Points</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Coalition arithmetic under strain:</strong> With no viable two-party majority and a fragmentation index of 6.14, every plenary vote requires multi-group coalition building. March votes on environmental and digital files will reveal whether the EPP can consistently assemble working majorities without the Greens/EFA — or whether it must rotate partners depending on the policy domain.</li>
              <li><strong>PfE and ESN influence:</strong> The new far-right groups (Patriots for Europe, 84 seats; Europe of Sovereign Nations, 25 seats) will attempt to shape migration and sovereignty debates. Their capacity to influence outcomes through abstention or strategic voting deserves close monitoring.</li>
              <li><strong>Defence spending consensus:</strong> Cross-party convergence on EU defence spending and procurement reform could produce one of EP10's first genuinely cross-ideological legislative achievements — watch AFET and SEDE for signals.</li>
              <li><strong>Enlargement conditionality:</strong> Western Balkans and Eastern Partnership progress reports may trigger political debates on the pace and conditions of EU enlargement, with implications for neighbourhood policy resources.</li>
              <li><strong>Budget oversight tensions:</strong> BUDG and CONT committee scrutiny of NextGenerationEU disbursements and Recovery and Resilience Facility milestones will test the Parliament's oversight capacity in the context of fiscal consolidation pressures.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section class="international-context">
            <h2>International Context</h2>
            <p>March 2026 unfolds against a complex external backdrop. Transatlantic dynamics continue to evolve as both the EU and the United States navigate trade tensions and technology governance divergences. The EU's strategic autonomy agenda gains urgency amid persistent geopolitical tensions in the eastern neighbourhood and growing competition for critical raw materials and semiconductor supply chains. The Parliament's external-facing committees — AFET, INTA, and the interparliamentary delegations — will address EU positioning on trade diversification, energy security partnerships, and multilateral governance reform. Spring European Council preparations will also begin shaping the Parliament's bargaining position on institutional priorities for the remainder of EP10's first half.</p>
