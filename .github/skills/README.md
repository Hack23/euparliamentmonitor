# EU Parliament Monitor - Skills Library

## Purpose

Skills are reusable knowledge units that encode Hack23's security policies, architecture patterns, quality standards, intelligence analysis methodologies, business strategy, and compliance requirements. Each skill provides explicit, actionable rules that GitHub Copilot applies during development.

**Skills auto-load via GitHub Copilot.** Reference specific skills when working in relevant areas.

## How to Use Skills

### For GitHub Copilot
Skills auto-load when working in Hack23 repositories. Copilot references these skills to generate secure, compliant, accessible code.

### For Developers
1. **Reference skills** before starting new work
2. **Follow MUST rules** — these are non-negotiable
3. **Apply patterns** from examples in each skill
4. **Update skills** when policies or standards change

### For Custom Agents
Agents document which skills they leverage. See each agent's "Skills Reference" section.
