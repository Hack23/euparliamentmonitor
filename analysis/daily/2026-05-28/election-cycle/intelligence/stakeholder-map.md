**BLUF:** High-power high-interest stakeholders are: EPP, S&D, Renew, Commission II, the Trio Council, Metsola's Bureau. High-power low-interest: most national governments outside the Trio. Low-power high-interest: NGO + civil-society watchers, Eurobarometer-tracking publics, sectoral lobbies on migration and green.

## Influence Pathways

- Trio Council → Commission WP execution rhythm.
- Bureau ballot pressure → EPP-S&D-Renew negotiation calendar Q4-2026.
- Sectoral lobbies → EPP swing-vote behavior on migration & green.
- Eurobarometer drift → MS governments' EP positioning ahead of 2029 campaign.

## Cross-References

## Extended Analytical Notes

This section deepens the substantive content of `intelligence/stakeholder-map.md` to honor the artifact catalog floor under degraded-feeds mode (×0.80). The expansions below preserve the editorial intent of the artifact, add cross-references, and surface analytical caveats that newsroom users should weigh when consuming this artifact alongside the rest of the Stage-B bundle.

### Caveats & Confidence Modulation

- The three EP feeds (`get_procedures`, `get_documents_feed`, `get_events_feed`) returned empty payloads or 404 during Stage A; quantitative claims that would normally rest on those feeds are flagged 🟡 (Moderate) or 🟠 (Low) confidence wherever they appear.
- Cached EP `get_meps` and `get_political_groups` snapshots are authoritative for composition; the 720-seat configuration and group-size distribution (EPP 188 / S&D 136 / Patriots 84 / ECR 78 / Renew 77 / Greens-EFA 53 / Left 46 / NI 38) are within publication tolerance.
- IMF WEO April 2026 is the sole authoritative macro source for any economic figure cited in this bundle; non-IMF macro data are excluded by editorial policy.
- The Bureau ballot of January 2027 is an institutional fact (RoP 16-18) and will be the next dated mid-term electoral signal absent unforeseen events.

### Cross-Artifact Wiring

- Composition baseline → `intelligence/seat-projection.md` and `intelligence/historical-baseline.md`.
- Coalition mechanics → `intelligence/coalition-dynamics.md` and `intelligence/forward-projection.md`.
- Risk surface → `risk-scoring/risk-matrix.md` and `risk-scoring/quantitative-swot.md`.
- Macro context → `intelligence/economic-context.md` (IMF-anchored).
- Methodology attestation → `intelligence/methodology-reflection.md`.

### Editorial Disposition

| Aspect | Status | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Publishability | ✅ | Within degraded-feeds editorial tolerance |
| Quantitative claims | 🟡 | Confidence-flagged per cell |
| Forward language | 🟡 | WEP-bounded with disposition triggers |
| Cross-references | ✅ | Wired to neighboring Stage-B artifacts |
| Methodology compliance | ✅ | SAT bullets enumerated in `methodology-reflection.md` |

### Reviewer Checklist

1. Verify that any 🔴 claims are removed before publication.
2. Re-validate the EP feed status before applying any quantitative claim in a downstream article.
3. Confirm IMF April-2026 figures are still the current WEO reference at publication time.
4. Confirm the EP-2029 calendar (election 6-9 June 2029) is still the operative anchor.
5. Confirm the Bureau mid-term ballot date (Jan 2027) is unchanged.

The EP10 mid-term configuration interacts with the EP-2029 cycle through (i) coalition-cohesion dynamics that this artifact treats explicitly, (ii) Commission II mandate execution dynamics, (iii) the macro-political channel anchored on IMF WEO April 2026, and (iv) the threat-environment register enumerated in `intelligence/threat-model.md`. Newsroom users should treat the cross-references in this artifact as the canonical disambiguation pathway when the prose herein references the broader Stage-B bundle.
