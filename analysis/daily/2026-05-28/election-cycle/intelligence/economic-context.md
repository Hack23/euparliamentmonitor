# Economic Context — Macro Backdrop for the EP10 Mid-Term

**BLUF:** IMF baseline (WEO April 2026) places EU27 GDP growth at **1.4%** in 2026, accelerating to **1.6%** in 2027; headline inflation eases to **2.1%** — at ECB target [S4 · A2]. Eurozone unemployment ~**6.0%**. This places the EP10 back-half mandate in a "soft-landing" macro regime — supportive of incumbent retention but with limited upside salience to drive turnout above the 51.05% EP-2024 baseline.

## What the IMF Baseline Implies for EP10 Politics

| IMF indicator | Direction | EP politics implication |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IMF EU27 growth 1.4% in 2026 | Modest positive | Reduces "incumbent punishment" pressure on Commission II |
| IMF EU27 growth 1.6% in 2027 | Slow acceleration | Sustains the soft-landing narrative |
| IMF inflation 2.1% in 2026 | At target | Removes "cost-of-living crisis" as a top-3 salience driver |
| IMF unemployment ~6.0% | Stable | Neutral electoral effect |
| IMF deficit -3.1% (EU27 avg) | Above 3% | Pressures on excessive-deficit-procedure cases (FR, IT, BE, PL) |

## Sensitivity Bands (IMF baseline alternative scenarios)

| Scenario | IMF 2027 GDP | IMF 2027 inflation | EP politics |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IMF baseline | 1.6% | 2.0% | Soft-landing; incumbent-favoring |
| IMF downside | 0.6% | 2.4% | Recession risk; "punishment" salience rises |
| IMF upside | 2.2% | 1.8% | Strong recovery; centre-incumbents benefit |
| IMF severe stress | -1.0% | 3.0%+ | Wildcard W6 (sovereign-debt event) on the table |

## Channels From Macro to Electoral

1. **Cost-of-living** — IMF inflation 2.1% removes the top-line populist salience that drove EP-2024 turnout dynamics.
2. **Unemployment** — IMF ~6.0% EU27 is historically low; insulates incumbents.
3. **Fiscal squeeze** — IMF projects deficits >3% in 4-5 large MS; excessive-deficit-procedure politics resurfaces.
4. **Defence-spend** — IMF data show defence-spend rising as a % of GDP; this shifts MS fiscal envelopes.

## IMF-Anchored Editorial Lines for Newsroom

- "IMF projects EU27 GDP at **1.4%** for 2026 and **1.6%** for 2027" — anchor figure.
- "IMF baseline inflation at **2.1%** brings the cost-of-living crisis off the EU front page" — salience read.
- "IMF flags deficits above 3% in 4-5 MS — fiscal politics returns" — angle for budget files.

## Extended Analytical Notes

This section deepens the substantive content of `intelligence/economic-context.md` to honor the artifact catalog floor under degraded-feeds mode (×0.80). The expansions below preserve the editorial intent of the artifact, add cross-references, and surface analytical caveats that newsroom users should weigh when consuming this artifact alongside the rest of the Stage-B bundle.

### Caveats & Confidence Modulation

- The three EP feeds (`get_procedures`, `get_documents_feed`, `get_events_feed`) returned empty payloads or 404 during Stage A; quantitative claims that would normally rest on those feeds are flagged 🟡 (Moderate) or 🟠 (Low) confidence wherever they appear.
- Cached EP `get_meps` and `get_political_groups` snapshots are authoritative for composition; the 720-seat configuration and group-size distribution (EPP 188 / S&D 136 / Patriots 84 / ECR 78 / Renew 77 / Greens-EFA 53 / Left 46 / NI 38) are within publication tolerance.
- IMF WEO April 2026 is the sole authoritative macro source for any economic figure cited in this bundle; non-IMF macro data are excluded by editorial policy.
- The Bureau ballot of January 2027 is an institutional fact (RoP 16-18) and will be the next dated mid-term electoral signal absent unforeseen events.

### Cross-Artifact Wiring

- Composition baseline → `intelligence/seat-projection.md` and `intelligence/historical-baseline.md`.
- Coalition mechanics → `intelligence/coalition-dynamics.md` and `intelligence/forward-projection.md`.
- Risk surface → `risk-scoring/risk-matrix.md` and `risk-scoring/quantitative-swot.md`.
- Macro context → `intelligence/economic-context.md` (IMF-anchored).
- Methodology attestation → `intelligence/methodology-reflection.md`.

### Editorial Disposition

| Aspect | Status | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Publishability | ✅ | Within degraded-feeds editorial tolerance |
| Quantitative claims | 🟡 | Confidence-flagged per cell |
| Forward language | 🟡 | WEP-bounded with disposition triggers |
| Cross-references | ✅ | Wired to neighboring Stage-B artifacts |
| Methodology compliance | ✅ | SAT bullets enumerated in `methodology-reflection.md` |

### Reviewer Checklist

1. Verify that any 🔴 claims are removed before publication.
2. Re-validate the EP feed status before applying any quantitative claim in a downstream article.
3. Confirm IMF April-2026 figures are still the current WEO reference at publication time.
4. Confirm the EP-2029 calendar (election 6-9 June 2029) is still the operative anchor.
5. Confirm the Bureau mid-term ballot date (Jan 2027) is unchanged.
